% Title: Computing Robustly Forward Invariant Sets for Mixed-Monotone
%        Systems

% Description:  This script generates Figure 2.
%               An invariant rectangle is computed via analysis of 
%               equilibria in the embedding space.  The smallest robustly 
%               forward invariant set in X is also computed via exhaustive
%               simulation.
%               This script requires the external file Ex2_data.mat,
%               availible though the GaTech FactsLab GitHub
